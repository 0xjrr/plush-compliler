# PLush Compiler

Welcome to the official repository for the PLush Compiler, developed as part of the compilers course. This compiler is designed to translate PLush programming language code into executable machine code. PLush is a simple, yet powerful programming language designed to teach the fundamentals of programming language design and compiler construction.

## Language Description

PLush is designed with simplicity and readability in mind, supporting basic programming constructs and types. Here's a quick overview of the language features:

- **Comments**: Start with `#` and end at the end of the line.
- **Whitespace Insensitivity**: Spaces, tabs, and newlines are ignored outside of string literals.
- **Declarations and Definitions**: Programs are composed of declarations or definitions that precede the main body.
- **Data Types**: Supports `double`, `int`, `string`, `void`, and parametric arrays (e.g., `[double]`, `[int]`, `[[int]]`).
- **Variables**: Supports both constant (`val`) and mutable (`var`) variables.
- **Functions**: Functions can either be defined with a body of code or declared for external linkage.
- **Control Structures**: Includes `if` statements with optional `else` blocks and `while` loops.
- **Expressions**: Supports binary operators with C-like precedence, unary operators, literals (boolean, integer, float, string), and variable/index access.

## Getting Started

To get started with the PLush Compiler, clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plush-compiler.git
```

Ensure you have the necessary environment to compile and run the compiler. Instructions for setting up the environment are provided in the subsequent sections.

## Installation

Before you can use the PLush Compiler, you need to set up your environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plush-compiler.git
   ```
2. **Build the Compiler** (assuming a UNIX-like environment):
   ```
   cd plush-compiler
   #TODO
   ```

## Usage

To compile a PLush program, use the following command:

```
 #TODO
```

This will generate an executable or an intermediate representation, depending on the build configuration.
